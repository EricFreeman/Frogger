Frogger
=======
A full 3D Frogger clone I made when I was 13.  I didn't know what a frame limiter was when I programmed this so make sure to run it on a computer with a max of 384mb of RAM, a 1.6 ghz CPU, and onboard gfx if you want it to be playable.  Otherwise it runs at approximately 999,999,999 FPS.
